    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Shrimp scampi, it's the dish so nice, they named it twice. Well, sort of.
      The word "scampi" is Italian for the meaty tail portion of a prawn.
      Specifically, the large Dublin Bay prawn, a.k.a., lobsterette, or
      langoustine if you prefer. They're not exactly what we'd call shrimpy.
      Okay, so more than anything the term "shrimp scampi" is like saying
      "shrimp done in the style of prawns." In other words, with yummy garlic
      butter. At its most basic, shrimp scampi is shrimp bathed in garlicky
      butter and blasted under the broiler. So easy, so perfect. No wonder it's
      a go-to recipe for busy weeknight meals. And yet, as with most things,
      there's room for a little tinkering. And here, we've gathered some simple,
      5-star takes on the simple shrimp scampi theme. These are 14 ways to make
      shrimp scampi the perfect weeknight
